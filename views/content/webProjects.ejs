                        This site was a joint collaboration between Centennial College and McMaster University. We were assigned to create a gamification platform for the McMaster Health Informatics course so that students instead of receiving grades and getting assignments will receive badges and complete quests. It was created using MEAN Stack and hosted on Heroku.
