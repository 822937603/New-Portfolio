      <p style="font-size:16px;">(TOJam screenshot) 
        <br>
        This is a game we made at TOJam 2018. The theme for TOJam was “Winning is for Losers”. Competing cars bump into each other to keep a bomb and use power ups until the time on the bomb runs out! The car with the bomb at the end will win the game!

        <br>
        Power Surge is a game that I produced as part of Dumb Luck Studios, a startup collaboration with my Centennial Colleagues. In Power Surge, your character is an electrode. Your task is to power the house that has been darkened by unknown forces. You will travel along the power lines from appliance to appliance to restore light within themed environments.

      <p style="font-size:16px;">(JR screenshot) 
        <br>
        Jim’s Revenge was created during a Centennial College Hackathon. The game was based on old dungeon crawlers where players fight though room after room of monsters. The demo provided was a proof of concept with programmer art.

        This game was one of the first 3D games I made. The objective is to find parts of a crossbow to assemble while avoiding the deadly Knights hot on your trail.

        <br>
        This is my first game I ever made. This is a naval combat game where the player is trying to get through a missile bombardment with his ship. The player must either dodge or fire his own missiles to deflect enemy fire while picking up as many supply crates as possible.
